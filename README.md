5- No summary of additional work after presentation

6- We developed our model based on the foundational "Grayscale Image Colorizations using GANs" concept. Instead of TensorFlow, we utilized PyTorch for implementation. We modified the architecture for both the generator and discriminator to better align with our desired outputs. Additionally, we incorporated various types of noise and introduced colorization as an additional functionality of the model.
